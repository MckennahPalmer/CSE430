| Name | 1.2.1.2 Score Sheet |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Purpose | Scores and holds all of the scores associated with a plan. |
| Description | Holds and calculates all of the scores from a semester plan. Scores include walking score, professor score, break score, time of day (TOD) score, and day of week (DOW) score. |
| Requirements | Requirements 10-13 |
| Elements | 
| | 1.2.1.2.1  ScoreSheet::ScoreSheet(): Constructor for the Score Sheet that initializes all the score computations.
| | 1.2.1.2.2  ScoreSheet::calculateOverallProfessorScore(): Takes a semester plan and related data to compute an overall professor score.
| | 1.2.1.2.4  ScoreSheet::computeWalkScore(): Takes a semester plan and relevant data to compute a score representing how well the plan aligns with a users walking preference.
| | 1.2.1.2.5  ScoreSheet::getWalkDistance(): Returns a walk distance between two given locations.
| | 1.2.1.2.6  ScoreSheet::computeBreakTimeScore(): Takes a semester plan and computes an overall break time score that represents how closely break times match with the user’s preference.
| | 1.2.1.2.7  ScoreSheet::getBreakTime(): Returns a break time between two given class objects.
| | 1.2.1.2.8  ScoreSheet::computeTODScore: Takes a semester plan and computes an overall TOD score that represents how closely the classes times of day match with the user’s preference.
| | 1.2.1.2.10 ScoreSheet::computeTotalScore: Takes all of the previously calculated scores and returns a overall score that represents how well the plan aligns with all the user's preferences.|
| | suggestionPackage: A collection of data required to make a JarvisSuggestion(See 1.2.1.1.7) and subsequently SemesterPlans and ScoreSheets. |
| | SemesterPlan: An object holding all of data, such as classes, that makes up a semester plan. |
| | totalProfessorScore: The overall professor score for the semester plan.
| | walkScore: A score representing how closesly the SemesterPlan's walking distance aligns with the users walking preference. |
| | breakTime: The time between two classes. |
| | breakTimeScore: A score represnting how closely a SemesterPlan's breaks line up with the users break preference. |
| | TODScore: A score representing how closely a SemesterPlan's Time of Day (TOD) aligns with the users TOD preference. |
| | scores: All of the scores. |
| | totalScore: A score calculated from all previous scores that represents how well the plan aligns with all the user's preferences. |
| | ScoreSheet: An object consisting of all the calculated scores and the total scores of a SemesterPlan. |
