| Name | 1.3.1.1.1 Convert to SQL |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Purpose | This is where the request made from the front end is converted into a language the database understands: SQL. |
| Description | The schedule to be inserted is encoded in the request object. The table to be pulled from and the data to be pulled are also encoded in the request object. This portion of code will convert that into SQL. |
| Requirements | 4, 6, 13 |
| Elements | req: the request from the front end Server. |
|          | body: the body of the request holds the payload for the request. |
|          | schedule: if there is a schedule to be inserted into the database, it will be here. |
|          | rows: the schedule will specify which rows it needs to insert into. |
|          | info: the schedule will specify what data (info) needs to be inserted into the table. |
|          | table: holds the name of the table the request wants to pull information from. |
|          | constraints: if the request wants to limit the data it receives, those limitations will be found here. |
|          | query: the query generated from the request. Returned in string format to 1.3.1.1 Manage Queries. |
