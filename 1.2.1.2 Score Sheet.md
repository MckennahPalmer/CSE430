| Name | 1.2.1.2 Score Sheet |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Purpose | Scores and holds all of the scores associated with a plan. |
| Description | Holds and calculates all of the scores from a semester plan. Scores include walking score, professor score, break score, time of day (TOD) score, and day of week (DOW) score. |
| Requirements | Requirements 10-13 |
| Elements | 
| | 1.2.1.2.1 ScoreSheet::ScoreSheet(): Constructor for the Score Sheet that initializes all the score computations.
| | 1.2.1.2.2 computeProfessorScore: Takes a semester plan and computes an overall professor score.
| | 1.2.1.2.3 retrieveProfessorRatings: Returns all the rating info on a given professor from RateMyProfessor using their name and department.
| | 1.2.1.2.4 computeWalkScore: Takes a semester plan and computes an overall walk score that represents how closely walk time matches with the user’s preference.
| | 1.2.1.2.5 getWalkDistance: Returns a walk distance between two given locations.
| | 1.2.1.2.6 computeBreakScore: Takes a semester plan and computes an overall break score that represents how closely break times match with the user’s preference.
| | 1.2.1.2.7 getBreakTime: Returns a break time between two given class objects.
| | 1.2.1.2.8 computeTODScore: Takes a semester plan and computes an overall TOD score that represents how closely the classes times of day match with the user’s preference.
| | 1.2.1.2.9 computeDOWScore: Takes a semester plan and computes an overall DOW score that represents how closely the classes days of the week match with the user’s preference. |
