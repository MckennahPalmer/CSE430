| Name | 1.2.1 Algorithm Component |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Purpose | Creates and scores the semester plans that will be handed to the user. |
| Description | The logic that handles the creation, scoring, and suggestions of semester plans that will be delivered to the user consisting of 3 main components and their sub-components. |
| Requirements | Requirements 9-16 |
| Elements | 
| | 1.2.1.1 Jarvis Suggests: Suggests the plan with its attached scores including scores such as Professor Score, Walk Score, etc. |
| | 1.2.1.2 Score Sheet: Collection of subcomponents that score a plan in a variety of ways. |
| | 1.2.1.3 Semester Plan: Creates semester plans that align with in the closest way with the user’s preferences while utilizing class data, distance data, professor data, and more. |
| | 1.2.1.3.1 Create Semester Plans: Creates a collection of closely scheduled plans that closely align with user preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.1 Compute Walk Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s walking preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.2 Compute Professor Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent the quality of professors represented in the plan. |
| | 1.2.1.2.3 Compute Break Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s break preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.4 Compute TOD Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s time of day preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.5 Compute DOW Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s day of week preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.1.1 Create Jarvis Suggestions: Combines the plan with its associated scores to create a Jarvis Suggestion. |
