| Name | 1.2.1 Algorithm Component |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Purpose | Creates and scores the semester plans that will be handed to the user. |
| Description | The logic that handles the creation, scoring, and suggestions of semester plans that will be delivered to the user consisting of 3 main components and their sub-components. |
| Requirements | Requirements 9-16 |
| Elements | 
| | 1.2.1.1 Jarvis Suggests: Suggests the plan with its attached scores including scores such as Professor Score, Walk Score, etc. |
| | 1.2.1.2 Score Sheet: Collection of subcomponents that score a plan in a variety of ways. |
| | 1.2.1.3 Semester Plan: Creates semester plans that align with in the closest way with the user’s preferences while utilizing class data, distance data, professor data, and more. |
| | 1.2.1.3.1 Create Semester Plans: Creates a collection of closely scheduled plans that closely align with user preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.1 Compute Walk Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s walking preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.2 Compute Professor Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent the quality of professors represented in the plan. |
| | 1.2.1.2.3 Compute Break Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s break preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.4 Compute TOD Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s time of day preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.2.5 Compute DOW Score: Calculates a numerical value to represent how closely the plan aligns with a user’s day of week preferences. |
| | 1.2.1.1.1 Create Jarvis Suggestions: Combines the plan with its associated scores to create a Jarvis Suggestion. |
| | user preferences: The user's preferences for their schedule, including but not limited to preferences such as Time Of Day (TOD) preference and Day of Week (DOW) preference.|
| | current plan: The user's current plan which includes data such as previously taken classes.|
| | class data: All of the data related to a class or section. Will contain data such as Time Of Day, Day Of Week, Location, Professor, etc.|
| | map data: The data concerning the BYU-I map. This will allow distance between classes to be calculated.|
| | professor data: All of the data concerning a professor including name, department, rate my professor scores, etc.|
| | Semester Plan: A plan containing and compiling all of the data related to the created semester plan. This will include classes, professors, and more.|
| | Score: A score object holding all of the related scores and other metrics associated with the scoring of a semester plan.|
| | Jarvis Suggestion: A combination of the semester plan and it's associated scores that will be delivered to the user via the controller.|
